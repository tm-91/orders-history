## components overview

An application consists of two components: the Billing System and an Application.

Billing System handles actions for install/uninstall and subscription. If your app is being installed to the shop, an App Store calls it with a request according to the manual: https://developers.dreamcommerce.com/developers/appstore/billing-system

An Application handles actions for your purposes. Feel free to extend it!

### ``billing_index.php``

An App Store should be pointed to this file as an Billing System entrypoint.

### ``index.php``

Application bootstrap. Handles your logic.
